  title: When I Too Long Have Looked Upon Your Face
  language: eng
  text: |
    When I too long have looked upon your face,
    Wherein for me a brightness unobscured
    Save by the mists of brightness has its place,
    And terrible beauty not to be endured,
    I turn away reluctant from your light,
    And stand irresolute, a mind undone,
    A silly, dazzled thing deprived of sight
    From having looked too long upon the sun.
    Then is my daily life a narrow room
    In which a little while, uncertainly,
    Surrounded by impenetrable gloom,
    Among familiar things grown strange to me
    Making my way, I pause, and feel, and hark,
    Till I become accustomed to the dark.
