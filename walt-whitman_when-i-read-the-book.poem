  text: |
    When I read the book, the biography famous,
    And is this then (said I) what the author calls a man's life?
    And so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life?
    (As if any man really knew aught of my life,
    Why even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real life,
    Only a few hints, a few diffused faint clews and indirections
    I seek for my own use to trace out here.)
