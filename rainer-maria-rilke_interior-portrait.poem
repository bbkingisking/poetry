  author: Rainer Maria Rilke
  language: eng
  text: |
    You don't survive in me
    because of memories;
    nor are you mine because
    of a lovely longing's strength.

    What does make you present is
    the ardent detour that
    a slow tenderness traces
    in my blood.

    I do not need to see you appear;
    being born sufficed for me
    to lose you a little less.
