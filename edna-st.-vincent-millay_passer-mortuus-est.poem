    Death devours all lovely things:
    Lesbia with her sparrow
    Shares the darkness, â€” presently
    Every bed is narrow.

    Unremembered as old rain
    Dries the sheer libation;
    And the little petulant hand
    Is an annotation.

    After all, my erstwhile dear,
    My no longer cherished,
    Need we say it was not love,
    Now that love has perished?
