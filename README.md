# poetry

A personal, structured poetry collection stored in `.poem` files â€” a YAML-based format built for both human legibility and programmatic access.

Each file in this repository represents a single poem, often with multiple versions (e.g. translations or original-language forms), and follows the [poem-schema](https://github.com/bbkingisking/poem-schema) specification.

This project exists primarily to serve my own reading, including integration with my custom poetry reader app, [leaves](https://github.com/bbkingisking/leaves). If you use [leaves](https://github.com/bbkingisking/leaves), the poems in this repo will work automatically with it.
