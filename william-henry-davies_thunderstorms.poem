    My mind has thunderstorms,
    That brood for heavy hours:
    Until they rain me words,
    My thoughts are drooping flowers
    And sulking, silent birds.

    Yet come, dark thunderstorms,
    And brood your heavy hours;
    For when you rain me words,
    My thoughts are dancing flowers
    And joyful singing birds.
