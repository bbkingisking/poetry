  title: Waiting
  author: William Ernest Henley

    A square, squat room (a cellar on promotion),
      Drab to the soul, drab to the very daylight;
      Plasters astray in unnatural-looking tinware;
      Scissors and lint and apothecary’s jars.

    Here, on a bench a skeleton would writhe from,
      Angry and sore, I wait to be admitted:
      Wait till my heart is lead upon my stomach,
      While at their ease two dressers do their chores.

    One has a probe—it feels to me a crowbar.
      A small boy sniffs and shudders after bluestone.
      A poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers.
      Life is (I think) a blunder and a shame.
