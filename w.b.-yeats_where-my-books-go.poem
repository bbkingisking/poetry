  title: Where My Books Go
  language: eng
  text: |
    All the words that I utter,
    And all the words that I write,
    Must spread out their wings untiring,
    And never rest in their flight,
    Till they come where your sad, sad heart is,
    And sing to you in the night,
    Beyond where the waters are moving,
    Storm-darken'd or starry bright.
